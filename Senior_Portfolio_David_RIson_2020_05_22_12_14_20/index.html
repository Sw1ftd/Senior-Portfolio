      <h1> Plans for the Future: </h1>
      <p>My ideal plans after high school would include some type of work with computers.  I have worked with computers since I was barely big enough to hold a mouse and have done a lot of things like programming, gaming and any kind of computer hacking.  My favorite subjects include things like Math and Computer Science so I feel this is what I am best at.  I am not sure I am interested in college because I want to start to work on things and I think I can be successful as long as I enjoy what I am doing. I plan to look for a job as soon as I can so I can work my way up to my goals.</p>
